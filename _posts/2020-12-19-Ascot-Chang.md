[Ascot Chang](https://www.ascotchang.com/) was my first real foray into the world of bespoke shirting in Hong Kong. In the past I had some shirts made by random Hong Kong makers in cheap fabrics such as poly-cotton blends or polyester, but at the time, I was really looking for something more.

What brought me to Ascot Chang was stumbling upon [Shirting Fantasy's Blog](https://shirtingfantasy.blogspot.com/) while I was browsing Styleforum's [Hong Kong Tailor's Thread](https://www.styleforum.net/threads/the-hong-kong-tailors-thread.33568/) and the [Hong Kong Bao Tou Thead](https://www.styleforum.net/threads/the-hong-kong-baotou-tailors-and-fabric-shops-for-cmt-thread.542082/) - both of which are great resources for learning about the tailoring environment in Hong Kong. My initial desire was to directly go to the CMT route (cut, make, trim) where you bring the raw cloth directly to the Sifus available in Hong Kong for them to make a garment out of. However, Shirting Fantasy mentioned to me that the first shirt is very important, as it would define the silhouette of all the shirts that follow, and thus, it was very important to have a good starting template. Since Ascot Chang has been known as the best shirtmaker in Hong Kong for several decades, I was keen to try them out. It was also a great helpful nudge that Shirting Fantasy had graciously accompanied me during my first visit to the Elements Branch.

Since I was only at Ascot Chang for the fit and not seriously about the fabric, I committed to their cheapest offerings which is their House Fabric. Even their cheapest fabrics begin at about HK$1,400 a shirt, and they have a three shirt minimum for the first order. As it had been so long ago, I decided on two white shirts of differing weight, and also a light blue shirt with an anti-wrinkle treatment. Unlike other shirt-makers, Ascot Chang actually offers fittings for their shirt. I was told that they also offer fitting shirts, although I wasn't offered one since I was wearing a dress shirt at the time.
